# Sharing Profile Details

In the context of enabling fine grained control over which contact sees  which part of one's profile, facing the concern that with strong system contact schema integration, only with consistent index and label value a contact detail can be tracked for changes and otherwise needs to be reassigned sharing preferences from scratch we decided for only allowing the assignment between contact details and circles to achieve an easy maintainability in case of profile changes / additions, accepting that the shared profile can not be managed fine grained for any contact individually.
