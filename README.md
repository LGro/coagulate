# Coagulate

Link your contact profile with others to keep them up to date whenever you move or get a new number, all while respecting everyone's privacy.

This [Flutter](flutter.dev) based implementation is derived from [VeilidChat](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilidchat/).
Accordingly, the Copyright to all files belongs to the Veilid developers unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Also, you might still find left over things called "veilidchat" that should be called "coagulate".
If you find any, feel free to open a small pull request ðŸ˜Š

## Development Setup

While this is still in development, you must have a clone of the [Veilid](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/) source checked out at `../veilid` relative to the working directory of this repository.

For platform specific development setup, see the scripts in `./dev-setup`.
